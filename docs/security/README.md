# Security Documentation

NoteVault is built with security as a foundational principle. This documentation covers our comprehensive security measures, best practices, compliance standards, and guidelines for maintaining a secure collaborative environment.

## 🔒 Security Overview

### Security Philosophy

NoteVault follows a **security-by-design** approach, incorporating security considerations at every level of the application architecture. Our security model is based on:

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access required for functionality
- **Privacy by Design**: User privacy protection built into core features
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response
